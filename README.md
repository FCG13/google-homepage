This is my first "solo" website project ( other than with codeacademy).
I will test my knowlegde of the intensive learning of HTML and CSS I did over the last week and see how much I got out of the courses and how much still needs to sink in. 
I am a total beginner in web developing, and even thought I found HTML and CSS easy to understand, I think I will need to work on quite a few projects to be able to code fluently in both.
Looking forward to it !
